## A bit map image processor that runs on the command line interface. This takes in 3 args: a file path for a current bit map image, a file path where the new image will be saved and the name of the transormation you would like to perform. 
##The transformation choices are: 
bluelight: turns all channels black except the blue channel.
invert: inverts the colors
bright: adds a yellow hue to the image
finelines: ads narrow vertical lines to the image
